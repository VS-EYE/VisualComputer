## Project Overview

This project aims to classify diabetic retinopathy from retinal images using deep learning models. It utilizes a genetic algorithm-based approach to optimize hyperparameters such as data augmentation, batch size, learning rate, and optimizer choices. The model's architecture is based on the InceptionV3 model, and the dataset contains three classes: 

- Non Diabetic
- Diabetic TYPE1
- Diabetic TYPE2

The goal of this optimization is to improve model accuracy by exploring different configurations of hyperparameters, and the solution is validated on test data to evaluate its performance.
